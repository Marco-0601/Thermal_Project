Thermal Project on Cascade Refrigeration Cycle. Due to the high global warming potential of synthetic refrigerants, many of them are going to be outlawed. 
Therefore, there is a shift to using natural refrigerants such as carbon dioxide and ammonia. One common industrial freezer system is a CO2-ammonia cascade system. Here, the CO2 operates on the cold side and ammonia on the hot side. 
The freezer must operate at -20 C. If we want to install this system in the East bay, what will be the optimum temperatures for CO2 in the condenser and ammonia in the evaporator? 
We will solve this problem in this notebook and also propose an industrial application along with its cooling capacity.
